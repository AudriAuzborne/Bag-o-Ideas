# Bag-o-Ideas
Public to the public 

Hello all!
I'm aspiring to be a game designer and decided it was time to get hip and create a GitHub.
I've been working on solo projects for school for about 2 years now.
I specialize in Unity and have made first person 3D platformers, third person 3D platformers, and a 2D side-scroller.
In Unity I've made different codes using Visual Studio for the character controllers, enviornments, and enemies.
I've modeled in Cinema4D as well for some of the animation classes. 

Thank you for reading!
